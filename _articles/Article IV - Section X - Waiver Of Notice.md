## Section X

**Waiver of Notice.** A Director may waive any notice provided for hereunder before or after the date and time stated in the notice, and such waiver shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. The waiver must be signed and in writing by such Director and filed with the minutes or the incorporated records, except that a Directors' attendance or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the Director of the meeting unless such Director states at the beginning of the meeting that he objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.
