  <li><strong>Quorum, Voting.</strong> Voting may be made at a meeting or outside of a meeting by electronic service mail. If voting is to be made outside a meeting, the Secretary must notify all members of the action to be taken at least five (5) but no more than sixty (60) days before the action to be taken. If voting is made outside a meeting, a vote may be submitted by telephone including voice mail, by electronic mail, by telecopy or by regular mail. A quorum will constitute at least one-half of the total number of members eligible to vote. The act of the majority of the eligible members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, or the majority of eligible members voting when a quorum is achieved outside of a meeting by the above method of voting, shall be the act of the Board of Directors. Members may participate in any meeting by teleconference, or by proxy.</li>
